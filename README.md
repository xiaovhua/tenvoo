# Official Code for [XXX]

> 🎉 This repository contains the official implementation of our paper:  
> **[Paper Title: XXX]**, accepted as an **Early Accept** to **MICCAI 2025**.

## 🔍 Introduction

This project provides the official PyTorch implementation of our MICCAI 2025 paper, where we introduce a novel method for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of 3D convolutional networks using **tensor networks**. Our approach enables efficient adaptation of large 3D models while maintaining strong performance across medical imaging tasks.

**Key highlights:**

- 🧠 Introduced **tensor decomposition-based PEFT** for 3D CNNs  
- 📦 Compatible with standard 3D backbones (e.g., 3D UNet, VNet)  
- 🚀 Significant reduction in trainable parameters without compromising accuracy
